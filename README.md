# Financial-Statement 
you are a Data scentist working for a consulting firm. one of your colleagues from the audting department has asked you to help them assess the financial statement of organization X. 
you have been supplied with two lists of data: monthly revenue and monthly expenses for the financial year in question. your task is to calculate the following financial metrics:

- profit for each month.
- profit after tax for each month (the tax is 30%).
- profit margin for each month - equals to profit after tax divided by revenue.
- good months - where the profit after tax was greater than the mean of the year.
- bad months - where the profit after tax was less than the mean of the year.
- the best month - where the profit after tax was max for the year.
- the worst month - where the profit after tax was min for the year.

note: your colleague has warned you that is oay for tax for any given month to be negative (in accounting terms, negative tax translates into a defrred tax asset).
